Bettany has played various high-profile roles and appeared in successful blockbusters. He has received award nominations for his work in cinema.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_of_Paul_Bettany>Early Life of Paul Bettany</span></h2><p>Paul Bettany was born on May 27th of 1971 in London, England. His parents were involved in acting, theater, and the performing arts. Bettany spent his youth living on campus at an all-girls boarding school where his father worked as a teacher.</p><p>Tragedy struck when Paul’s younger brother fell onto concrete after tumbling from a roof. The 8-year-old died from a cracked skull. The death had a profound effect on Paul as a 16-year-old, and he descended into drug use from that point onward.</p><p>Not long after his brother’s death, he left home and started busking on the streets of London for money. His parents eventually divorced. He found a job working in a home for the elderly, which enabled him to earn enough money to attend drama school.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Bettanys_Career_Highlights>Paul Bettany’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>Paul Bettany began his career as a theater actor and made his television debut in “Sharpe” before appearing in his first film, “Bent.” He landed his big break in 2001 as Geoffrey Chaucer in “A Knight’s Tale” and gained widespread recognition leading to his casting in “A Beautiful Mind.” Bettany continued to appear in films like “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,” “Dogville,” “Iron Man,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” and “Solo: A Star Wars Story.”</p><p>In 2018, Bettany joined Elizabeth Olsen in the upcoming Disney+ series “WandaVision.” In 2020, Paul joined the cast of the then-untitled film about the Cambridge Analytica Scandal.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Bettanys_Relationship_with_Jennifer_Connelly>Paul Bettany’s Relationship with Jennifer Connelly</span></h2><p>Paul Bettany met Jennifer Connelly on the set of “A Beautiful Mind” and started a long relationship with her that eventually led to marriage in 2003.</p><p>At the age of 15, Bettany had developed a deep crush for Connelly after seeing her appear as a child actor in films like “Once Upon a Time in America” and “Labyrinth.”</p><p>Connelly’s entrance into Bettany’s life came at an important moment, as he was struggling with depression and drug addiction. However, they didn’t date immediately after appearing together in “A Beautiful Mind.”</p><p>After the September 11th attacks, Bettany was overcome by an overwhelming urge to check on the well-being of Connelly, who he “barely knew.” While on the phone with her, he proposed and she accepted.</p><p>They have two children together and are considered one of the happiest couples in Hollywood. They make sure to protect their children from undue attention from reporters.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Bettanys_Name_Comes_Up_in_Johnny_Depps_Legal_Battle_Against_Amber_Heard>Paul Bettany’s Name Comes Up in Johnny Depp’s Legal Battle Against Amber Heard</span></h2><p>During Johnny Depp’s legal battle against ex-wife Amber Heard, it was revealed that he had exchanged unsavory texts with longtime friend Paul Bettany. The texts started off mildly inappropriate and took a sexual tone regarding Heard, but became increasingly shocking with Bettany suggesting they burn and drown her, and Depp suggesting he would have sex with her burnt corpse – with Bettany agreeing. Depp also admitted to supplying Bettany with drugs while the actor was grieving for his younger brother and using drugs together frequently, leading some to question whether he was enabling Bettany’s self-destructive behaviors during a dark period in his life.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Bettany_and_Jennifer_Connellys_Real_Estate_Investments>Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly’s Real Estate Investments</span></h2><p>In 2008, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly purchased a penthouse in Manhattan for $6.92 million. The property is located in Tribeca and has over 4,000 square feet of living space, a sunroom, and almost 1,400 square feet of private outdoor roof space. They sold the property in 2018 for $9 million.</p><p>Later that year, the couple upgraded to a $15.5-million townhouse in Brooklyn Heights. The townhouse has over 8,000 square feet of living space and offers stunning views of the city skyline, including the Statue of Liberty. Real estate agents described it as one of the most profitable real estate deals ever made in the borough.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC8wK6jZpqVqcGiuthmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaul-bettany-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpaul-bettany-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpaul-bettany-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpaul-bettany-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaul-bettany-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-bettany-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ronnie-wood.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ronnie-wood.html>Ronnie Wood Age, Married, Wife, Children, Grandchildren &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./spit-grave-reboot-reportedly-early-development.html>New I Spit On Your Grave Reboot Reportedly In Early Development</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./spit-grave-reboot-reportedly-early-development.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
