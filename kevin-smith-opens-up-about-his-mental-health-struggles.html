Smith told the publication on April 26 that he called a friend following the incident because of the “weird, dark place” he was in mentally and needed help. The<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a>&nbsp;star also mentioned that the event was so bad that he wouldn’t have opposed dying.&nbsp;Smith said,</p><p>“It was scary… At that moment, I wouldn’t have been averse to not being around any longer. I called a friend and said, ‘I’m in a weird, dark place. I need to go somewhere and get help.'”</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>Smith would ultimately check in to Sierra Tucson the day after the incident and stay there for a month, where he received therapy for his unresolved childhood trauma that occurred over 40 years ago. The filmmaker’s trauma included sexual abuse and fat shaming.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=835 data-injectable=true>Smith revealed that he was sexually abused at six, when an older unidentified boy forced him and his friend, a girl around the same age, to participate in explicit acts. At the time and later in Smith’s life, he always recounted that moment as the pair just “playing doctor in an alleyway.” But in treatment, his therapist shifted his perspective on the matter. Smith stated that his therapist described the act as sexual abuse because a third party instructed them “to do something” against their values.</p><p>“When a third party is instructing you to do something against your core values like that, that’s sexual abuse.”</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Fast forward to a few years later, when Smith was nine. The&nbsp;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&nbsp;star, who was in the fourth grade, recalled the embarrassing moment when his teacher made fun of his physical appearance and the size of his stomach in front of the entire class. Smith explained that after being publicly humiliated, he developed a persona of himself known as “the other guy” because he wanted “make people love him” before they noticed his size.&nbsp;</p><p>“I felt disgusting, like I didn’t matter. That’s when ‘the other guy’ started to appear. I decided to be entertaining and make people love me before they noticed I was fat.”</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>As Smith began to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> gain recognition</a> in 1994 for his film&nbsp;The Clerks, he disclosed that he would often use “the other guy” persona as a shield to hide his pain, something he did until recently when he went into treatment. Smith shared that his treatment consisted of individual and group therapy with people from different backgrounds, which was intimidating to him at first because he felt his issues weren’t as significant as those that were seeking treatment.&nbsp;He said,</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35>“In the beginning, it was tough to share when somebody’s talking about watching their friend get killed and I’m like, ‘Well, my fourth-grade teacher told me I was fat. But I learned that there’s no differentiation [between levels of trauma] to the human nervous system. Internally, trauma is trauma.’”</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>In addition to the star getting help for his past trauma, Smith has learned the strength of self-validation through the many exercises he received during treatment, including controlling one’s breath, something he still does today. Since leaving Sierra Tucson, Smith has made positive changes to care for his mental health, like no longer smoking weed, limiting his time on social media, and working less.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Smith wrapped up the interview by revealing that he is sharing his story because he wants people to know the importance of mental health and to provide the tools that have helped him recover to those that are suffering.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S4psLIp2SspZmptW67z56lrGWlpXqirs6uq2agmah6rrHNrZilZZiarq3Ax2aqraqlnLStsdJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkevin-smith-opens-up-about-his-mental-health-struggles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkevin-smith-opens-up-about-his-mental-health-struggles.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkevin-smith-opens-up-about-his-mental-health-struggles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkevin-smith-opens-up-about-his-mental-health-struggles.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkevin-smith-opens-up-about-his-mental-health-struggles.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkevin-smith-opens-up-about-his-mental-health-struggles.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amy-jacksons-ethnicity-confirmed-and-the-controversy-explained.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amy-jacksons-ethnicity-confirmed-and-the-controversy-explained.html>Amy Jacksons ethnicity confirmed, and the controversy explained</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./coy-stewart-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-531089-html.html>Coy Stewart Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./coy-stewart-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-531089-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
