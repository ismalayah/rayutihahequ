First, they became the first girl group in K-pop to chart a debut single on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart with Happiness. Red Velvet performed in North Korea as part of a special concert in April 2018, becoming the first K-pop group to perform in North Korea since 2003.

These include Prada, Miu Miu, Ferragamo, Damiani, and Hogan. As their luxury portfolio continues to grow, their net worth is only projected to increase. Furthermore, their inclusion on numerous celebrity power lists demonstrates their brand power around the globe. In 2019, Billboard declared Red Velvet as “the best idol group alive.” The South Korean government has also praised the group for helping to spread K-pop throughout the world.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>The members have been busy with solo activities this year, including Seulgi’s solo debut with “28 Reasons” and Joy’s drama, Once Upon a Small Town, but they found the time to release two mini albums in 2022.</p><h2 id=h-9-mamamoo data-injectable=false>9.

Originally a five-member group, TVXQ gained popularity in both Korea and Japan and the two remaining members are still some of the richest idols in the industry. As one of the pioneers of the Hallyu Wave, TVXQ has had several top hits, such as “Mirotic” and “Hug.” At one point, TVXQ ranked as one of the top foreign artists in Japan.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Among the top ten best-selling records in 2004, TVXQ’s debut album, Tri-Angle, debuted at #1 on the Korean charts.

The girls made history as the first K-pop girl group to perform at Coachella and were the first K-pop act to headline Hyde Park in July 2023.

They have had multiple successful tours and sold out the Tokyo Dome in 2014. Despite infrequent group activities since Sooyung, Tiffany, and Seohyun left SM Entertainment in October 2017, Girls’ Generation’s combined net worth is estimated to be a staggering $100 million. Lately, the girls have focused on their solo careers but reunited to release their seventh Korean full-length album,&nbsp;Forever 1,&nbsp;in August 2022, which peaked at number two on Korea’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Circle Chart</a>&nbsp;and sold over 185,600 copies in just its first week, doubling the first week sales of their last full album,&nbsp;Holiday Night.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>Endorsements have contributed significantly to the group’s net worth. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Girls’ Generation’s members</a> have appeared in many commercials and have promoted brands like LG, Casio, Intel, Goobne Chicken, Domino’s Pizza, Samantha Thavasa, and others.

The activities include starring roles in movies, dramas, and plays, appearing on variety shows, creating personal YouTube channels, and releasing solo albums. Among them, Yoona, Sooyoung, Yuri, and Seohyun have received attention because of their growth as actresses as well as the diversity of their roles.</p><h2 id=h-2-bts data-injectable=false>2. BTS</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=677 data-current-count=977 data-injectable=true>BTS is arguably the most famous K-pop group of all time, and understandably, they’re high-earners. The seven-member boy group debuted under Big Hit Entertainment in 2013 and initially achieved only moderate success. Now, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t heard of the group after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their successful singles</a>, world tours, and marketing campaigns. They have worked with brands such as Baskin-Robbins, LeSportsac, Sketchers, Mattel, Casetify, Tamagotchi, VT Cosmetics, Jamie Wander, McDonald’s, Baskin Robbins, and Casetify over their career. As of 2022, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the group’s net worth</a> is thought to be anywhere from $100 million to $150 million.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>In 2018, the Hyundai Research Institute reported that BTS generates $3.5 billion worth of economic value to South Korea each year. This number is reportedly increasing by $1.2 billion every year. In addition, they have also been credited with being one of the main reasons for the growth in music sales worldwide in 2018, amounting to a total of $19 billion in sales.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>According to Celebrity Net Worth, the BTS boys made US$170 million in 2019 from their Love Yourself World Tour, more than any other American band except Metallica.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Many K-pop groups live together in dorms, but BTS secured one of South Korea’s most expensive at Hannam the Hill thanks to its multimillion-dollar fortune. Per Allkpop, this complex houses other celebrities, such as Psy and actress Han Hyo-joo, as well as some high-rolling businessmen. Lifestyle Asia reports that the members also purchased their&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">own luxury apartments</a>&nbsp;for as much as US$7 million.</p><h2 id=h-1-exo data-injectable=false>1. EXO</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=776 data-current-count=1076 data-injectable=true>It may come as a surprise to some, but SM Entertainment’s boy group, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EXO</a>, is easily the richest K-Pop group. If reports are to be believed, the group is worth an insane $1 billion. EXO debuted in 2012 with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“MAMA”</a>&nbsp;with both Korean and Chinese versions and were the most popular boy group in South Korea for years after their debut, so it’s understandable that they’d be high-earners. It’s possible the high net worth could be inflated as a few media outlets think the number is closer to $100 million but the majority of media outlets report that EXO is a billion-dollar boy group. For example, Popnable examined the band’s earnings from the past seven years and found that they earned an average of US$2.5 million from 2016 to 2022.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>They are also involved in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a variety of activities</a> and projects, such as acting and solo music releases, in addition to their idol duties. “Don’t Mess Up My Tempo,” EXO’s best-selling album, sold more than 1.9 million copies. They’ve held many world tours and contributed greatly to SM Entertainment’s financial success. According to reports, SM made $188 million during the 4th quarter of 2018, with EXO contributing 31%.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Because of the group’s widespread influence, Forbes’ Korea Power Celebrity listed Exo among the top five most influential Korean celebrities from 2014 to 2018. Their album “Don’t Fight the Feeling” topped the iTunes Top Albums charts in at least 85 countries in 2021, according to Soompi.</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>As a result of their enviable reputation in K-pop, they have been endorsed by the likes of Nature Republic and Skechers, among others. One of the biggest brand deals EXO landed was with Samsung, serving as the company’s ambassador for the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. It paved the way for future partnerships, including an EXO-themed Galaxy S8. In addition, Skechers endorsed EXO’s D’Lites 2 Sweet Monster Collection. It later became popular as “EXO sneakers.”</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Moreover, EXO acted as South Korea’s tourism ambassadors for 2018, appearing in a number of international campaigns and advertisements. They’ve also been the poster boys for Kessler, SPAO, The Face Shop, and other brands.
