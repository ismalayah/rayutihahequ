Let us take a moment to understand his death cause and learn about those he left behind.</span></strong></p><p><span>The English singer-songwriter and guitarist was also an occasional Actor. He rose to fame with Dr. Feelgood, a pub rock/rhythm and blues band formed in the 1970s.</span></p><p><span>Dr. Feelgood and Wilko hugely influenced the English punk movement. The talented musician was also in Ian Drury and the Blockheads before he formed his band, the Wilko Johnson Band.</span></p><p><span>The punk icon, formerly an English teacher, also ventured into acting with the mute executioner Ser Ilyn Payne in&nbsp;</span><span>Game of Thrones</span><span>&nbsp;in 2011.</span></p><p><span>Wilko appeared in two seasons and four episodes: “The Kingsroad,” “Baelor,” “Fire and Blood,” and “Blackwater.” Later, HBO was forced to phase his character out due to his declining health.</span></p><p><strong><span>Also Read</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><span>Shanquella Robinson Murder Update: Is Cabo 6 Arrested?

Illness And Health</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>On November 21, 2022, Wilko Johnson passed away at home at the age of 75. The rock musician was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer in 2014, but it was later said to be treated, so the exact death cause is yet to be revealed.</span></p><p><span>The sad news was announced on his band Dr. Feelgood’s official Twitter page as they paid homage to the talented musician and Actor. The statement read: “This is the announcement we never wanted to make, and we do so with a hefty heart.”</span></p><p><span>The band also thanked fans for respecting the family’s privacy at this challenging time.</span></p><p><span>Wilko was initially diagnosed with terminal Pancreatic Cancer in 2013 and said he had just ten months to live after a lump was found in his stomach.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, he decided not to receive chemotherapy to focus on his music career. The following year, he released the album&nbsp;</span><span>Going Back Home</span><span>, a collaboration with Who’s Roger Daltrey.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Later in 2014, Wilko went for a second opinion following the suggestion of a fan, Chalie Chan. Further tests showed the musician’s Cancer was a neuroendocrine tumor – a rare but less aggressive malignancy.</span></p><p><span>In April 2014, he underwent a nine-hour operation at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge to have his tumors, weighing three kilograms, removed. He later told fans he was cancer-free at the Q Awards in October 2014.</span></p><p><span>“Now, I’m gradually coming to terms with the idea that my death is not imminent, that I am going to live on,” he said at the ceremony.</span></p><p><span>From 2014 until his death, the legendary punk guitarist continued performing live and had gigs around the UK earlier this year.</span></p><p><span>Tributes to the Wilko have come pouring in on social media, including those from rock band The Stranglers, Anton Newcombe, and Sleaford Mods.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wilko-johnson-family-he-is-survived-by-his-two-children></span><span>Wilko Johnson Family: He Is Survived By His Two Children</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Wilko Johnson was born John Peter Wilkinson in Canvey Island, Essex, England. Born on July 2, 1947, he was 75 at death,</span></p><p><span>In the past, he lived in Southend, England, with his wife Irene Knight and two sons, Matthew and Simon Johnson.</span></p><p><span>Irene was his childhood sweetheart, and the two had been together since they were teenagers. Unfortunately, Johnson was widowed after Irene died from Cancer in 2004.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Although Wilko admitted to cheating on his wife with dozens of women, he said his heart always belonged to his wife, and he was devastated when Irene died aged 56.</span></p><p><span>Wilko was romantically involved with a Japanese lady named Yuriko but never remarried. “I was with Irene for 40 years, and I couldn’t marry someone else. She was an absolute angel,” he once said.</span></p><p><span>One of their sons, Simon, followed in his dad’s footsteps and became a guitarist for the Southend-based band Eight Rounds Rapid.</span></p><p><strong><span>Explore More</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><span>Nikita Dragun Prison Update: A Transgender Beauty Influencer Was Put In A Men’s Jail, Arrest, And Charges</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BZobiwecmon6ern6N6pbHArZ9mm5GqwKZ5w6KbZqCVYrGqscNmpp9lk5a7pLHRZqClpJ6awLR5wKebZqCVlrm1tI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwilko-johnson-death-cause-did-he-died-of-cancer-illness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwilko-johnson-death-cause-did-he-died-of-cancer-illness-and-health.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwilko-johnson-death-cause-did-he-died-of-cancer-illness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwilko-johnson-death-cause-did-he-died-of-cancer-illness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwilko-johnson-death-cause-did-he-died-of-cancer-illness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwilko-johnson-death-cause-did-he-died-of-cancer-illness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./an-isolated-incident-of-poor-blue-beetle-ticket-sales-already-has-memers-rubbing-their-hands-in-glee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./an-isolated-incident-of-poor-blue-beetle-ticket-sales-already-has-memers-rubbing-their-hands-in-glee.html>An isolated incident of poor Blue Beetle ticket sales already has memers rubbing their hands i</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chilled-cot-helps-parents-grieve-stillborn-babies.html>Chilled cot helps parents grieve stillborn babies</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chilled-cot-helps-parents-grieve-stillborn-babies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
